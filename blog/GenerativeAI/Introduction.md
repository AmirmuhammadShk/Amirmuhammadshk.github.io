# 🌟 Introduction to Generative AI

## What Is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can **generate new content**—including text, images, audio, video, and even code—based on patterns learned from existing data. Rather than just analyzing or predicting data, these systems create it, simulating human-like creativity and expression.

Popular examples include:
- **ChatGPT** for text generation
- **DALL·E** for image generation
- **MusicLM** for composing music
- **Codex** for writing code

## How Does Generative AI Work?

Generative AI is typically powered by **machine learning**, especially **deep learning** techniques. Most modern systems are built using **transformer architectures**, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which are trained on vast datasets to learn complex patterns.

The workflow involves:
1. **Pretraining**: The model is trained on a large corpus of data.
2. **Fine-tuning**: It’s adapted to specific tasks or domains.
3. **Prompting**: Users input prompts to guide the model's output.
