# üëã Meet Amirmohammad Shakeri  

** Software Engineer | Linux & Cloud Systems Expert | AI/AGI Expert **  
*A decade of architecting intelligent systems that scale globally, optimize costs, and enable autonomous decision-making.*  

---  

## üöÄ Why Work With Me?  

I bridge **high-performance systems engineering** with **cutting-edge AI/AGI** to build infrastructure that doesn‚Äôt just run‚Äîit *adapts*. With nearly **10 years of experience**, I specialize in:  

- **Scalable Backend Systems**: Designing low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures (Python/Rust/C) for millions of requests/day.  
- **AI-Native Infrastructure**: Building LLM-powered agents, RAG pipelines, and multi-agent frameworks for real-world automation.  
- **Cloud & Linux Optimization**: Tuning kernels (40%+ latency reductions), automating DevOps, and deploying HPC-ready AI workloads.  

I thrive where **systems rigor meets AI innovation**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs rewriting monoliths into microservices or deploying self-optimizing AI backends.

## üí° Core Competencies  

### ü§ñ **AI/AGI & Autonomous Systems**  
- **LLM Engineering**: Production-grade RAG, tool-augmented agents (LangChain, Semantic Kernel), and enterprise workflow automation.  
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Frameworks for collaborative AI decision-making (AutoGen, reinforcement learning).  
- **AI Infrastructure**: Optimizing LLM inference, fine-tuning (Mistral, Phi-3), and MLOps pipelines (Kubeflow).  

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud & DevOps Architecture**  
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Terraform, Ansible, and Pulumi for reproducible, cost-efficient clouds (Azure/GCP/AWS).  
- **Kubernetes at Scale**: High-availability clusters, service mesh (Istrio/Linkerd), and GPU orchestration for AI.  
- **Observability & Security**: Zero-trust architectures, Prometheus/Grafana, and secrets management (Vault, SOPS).  

### üñ•Ô∏è **Backend & Distributed Systems**  
- **Performance-Centric APIs**: FastAPI, Django, and Rust services with PostgreSQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch.  
- **Event-Driven Architectures**: Kafka/Pulsar for real-time data pipelines and async processing.  
- **Linux Systems Programming**: Kernel tuning (zero-copy networking, eBPF), HPC environments, and Rust/C tooling.  

---  

## üî• Recent Work Highlights  

- **Scaled a monolithic API to 10M+ RPM** by decomposing into Kubernetes-native microservices with 40% cost savings.  
- **Slashed AI inference latency** by optimizing Linux TCP stacks and GPU memory allocation.  
- **Built an LLM-powered audit system** that automates 70% of compliance workflows for a Fortune 500 client.  

---  

## üåü Current Focus  

- **AI-First Backends**: Dynamically adaptive infrastructure using LLMs for auto-scaling and anomaly detection.  
- **Agent Ecosystems**: Multi-AI systems that collaborate on complex tasks (e.g., supply chain/logistics).  
- **Cloud-Native HPC**: Bare-metal performance in Kubernetes (eBPF, RDMA, and NUMA-aware scheduling).  

---  

## üì¨ Let‚Äôs Collaborate If You...  

- Need **scalable backend/AI systems** that balance performance and cost.  
- Are pushing **LLMs/agents to production** and need infra that won‚Äôt break.  
- Want to **optimize Linux/cloud stacks** for AI or distributed workloads.  
- Just want to geek out about **AGI, kernel hacking, or Rust performance tricks**.  

*Let‚Äôs build systems that think‚Äîand scale.*
